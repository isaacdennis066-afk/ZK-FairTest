# 🔒 ZK FairTest: Bias-Free Assessment Platform

Welcome to the fairest way to evaluate skills on the blockchain! This Web3 project leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) on the Stacks blockchain to enable anonymous, equitable testing—perfect for hiring, education, and certifications. Prove your abilities without exposing personal details, eliminating bias and ensuring merit-based outcomes.

## ✨ Features

🧠 **Anonymous Skill Proofs**  
Submit ZK proofs of test completion without revealing identity or answers.

⚖️ **Bias-Proof Matching**  
Employers or educators match candidates solely on verified scores, blind to demographics.

📊 **Decentralized Score Vault**  
Immutable storage of proof hashes and scores, verifiable by anyone.

🔍 **Revocable Certifications**  
Issue time-bound certs that candidates can revoke or update privately.

📈 **Analytics Dashboard**  
Aggregate anonymized data for diversity insights without compromising privacy.

🏆 **Reward Incentives**  
Stake tokens for honest participation; slash for fraud attempts.

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Candidates**

- Take an off-chain assessment (e.g., coding challenge or quiz).
- Generate a ZK proof attesting to your score without leaking details.
- Call `submit-proof` with your ZKP, test ID, and optional stake.
- Receive a unique cert ID—share it anonymously to prove competence!

**For Assessors (Employers/Educators)**

- Deploy or join a test suite via `create-test-suite`.
- Verify submissions with `validate-proof`—instant, trustless confirmation.
- Query `get-anon-score` for blind matching; unblind only on mutual consent.

**Under the Hood**

Powered by Clarity smart contracts on Stacks, this ensures atomic, secure transactions. ZKPs (integrated via off-chain circuits) keep everything private yet provable.
